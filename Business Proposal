The Problem in question is about finding where is better to live in a large City location. Both  New York City, USA, amd London, UK, 
are the financial capitals in their respective countries. This make it desirable to live there, and to start up businesses in and around 
the cities. This assignment will try to distinguish where would be better to live and to open up a business by considering house prices 
and crime rates in each location. Analysing where would be the best financially with consideration for crime rates and house prices. There
will be an analysis of coffee shops around each borough too. 

The target audience of this report and assignment is people who want to start up a business or employees who are looking to move around 
NYC or London. The result of this report will be useful for businesses because they can see how much it would cost to buy in different 
boroughs. The crime rate will help figure out if the places would be good for starting up a business. For employees, this report can show 
which areas would be best to move to while at a job in the big cities, to make sure them and their families would be safe and in budget. 

The datasets collected were from several sources. In the NYC data, I used the NYPD online database and the Department of Finance (DOF) to 
find each of the data sets I needed to solve the problem. For the London data, I used the "London Borough Profiles" data set from the 
London DataStore online. These are reputable sources to collect data from because they are official data collected by the authorities of 
each city. USing Foursquare to fid out which has the best reviewed coffee shops because some people enjoy living close to a coffee shop, 
or at least near/on the way to their work.
